# az-vm-laz-build

This project contains PowerShell scripts that use the Azure CLI to create, run, and delete an Azure VM to build a [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) ([Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) IDE) project.

The Lazarus project is developed on Linux. This set of scripts affords building a Windows executable in a (mostly) automated way.

The scripts are organized in steps that can be run individually.

The VM can also be used for debugging in the Lazarus IDE, via Remote Desktop, if there are Windows-specific issues to debug.

More details to come... (although distraction is a possibility ;-)
